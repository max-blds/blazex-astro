  - question: "How does your pricing model work?"
    answer: "We operate on a base retainer plus profit share model, not a percentage of ad spend. This aligns our interests with yours - we succeed when you succeed. The specific structure depends on your monthly ad spend and campaign goals."

  - question: "What platforms do you work with?"
